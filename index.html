  <h1 class="center">Environmental Conservation</h1>
  <p class="center">I put this as my cause because recently we've had some shocking studies that have come out. These studies give us 20 years before catastrophic environmental disasters become a norm. The only way that we can prevent this from happening is by making sudden changes in the way we treat the Earth, the biggest being our C02 emitions. This data set shows that transportation and electricity are the largest producers of CO2. This is important to my cause because I believe both of these industries can cut their CO2 emitions drastically. Electric cars are on the rise and are simply the most effective and luxurious way to cut down on transportation’s CO2 emitions. In turns of electricity, the biggest offender is creating heat. We burn coal or other recourses in order to create energy, when we could use solar power, wind power, etc. Tesla has even released a new type of house shingle that has solar panels built into them. These shingles are more durable and cost less than the regular house shingle. Environmental conservation is so important to me because I believe we can begin to undo the damage we have done, and because if we don’t, the Earth will become unlivable in our life time. </p>
